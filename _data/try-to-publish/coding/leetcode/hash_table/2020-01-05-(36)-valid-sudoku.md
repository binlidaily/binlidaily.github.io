## Description

Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character `'.'`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
[
  ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being 
    modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```

**Note:**

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
- The given board contain only digits `1-9` and the character `'.'`.
- The given board size is always `9x9`.


## Solutions
### 1. Hash Table

```python
# Time: O(9n)
# Space: O(n)
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        return (self.is_row_valid(board) and
            self.is_col_valid(board) and
            self.is_square_valid(board))

    def is_row_valid(self, board):
        for row in board:
            if not self.is_unit_valid(row):
                return False
        return True

    def is_col_valid(self, board):
        for col in zip(*board):
            if not self.is_unit_valid(col):
                return False
        return True
        
    def is_square_valid(self, board):
        for i in (0, 3, 6):
            for j in (0, 3, 6):
                square = [board[x][y] for x in range(i, i + 3) for y in range(j, j + 3)]
                if not self.is_unit_valid(square):
                    return False
        return True
        
    def is_unit_valid(self, unit):
        unit = [i for i in unit if i != '.']
        return len(set(unit)) == len(unit)
# 504/504 cases passed (88 ms)
# Your runtime beats 96.72 % of python3 submissions
# Your memory usage beats 100 % of python3 submissions (12.7 MB)
