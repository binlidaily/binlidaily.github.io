## Description

Write an iterator that iterates through a run-length encoded sequence.

The iterator is initialized by `RLEIterator(int[] A)`, where `A` is a run-length encoding of some sequence. More specifically, for all even `i`, `A[i]` tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value `A[i+1]` is repeated in the sequence.

The iterator supports one function: `next(int n)`, which exhausts the next `n` elements (`n >= 1`) and returns the last element exhausted in this way. If there is no element left to exhaust, `next` returns `-1` instead.

For example, we start with `A = [3,8,0,9,2,5]`, which is a run-length encoding of the sequence `[8,8,8,5,5]`. This is because the sequence can be read as "three eights, zero nines, two fives".

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["RLEIterator","next","next","next","next"], [[[3,8,0,9,2,5]],[2],[1],[1],[2]]
Output: [null,8,8,5,-1]
Explanation: 
RLEIterator is initialized with RLEIterator([3,8,0,9,2,5]).
This maps to the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].
RLEIterator.next is then called 4 times:

.next(2) exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [8, 5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 5.  The remaining sequence is now [5].

.next(2) exhausts 2 terms, returning -1.  This is because the first term exhausted was 5,
but the second term did not exist.  Since the last term exhausted does not exist, we return -1.
```

**Note:**

1. `0 <= A.length <= 1000`
2. `A.length` is an even integer.
3. `0 <= A[i] <= 10^9`
4. There are at most `1000` calls to `RLEIterator.next(int n)` per test case.
5. Each call to `RLEIterator.next(int n)` will have `1 <= n <= 10^9`.


## Solutions
　　这里主要搞清楚题目是啥意思，[Run-length Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) 要明白是怎么回事，然后结合题意要理解，比如这里的例子：

```python
# 输入：其实是编码后的字串
[3,8,0,9,2,5]

# 输出：编码前的字串
[8,8,8,5,5] 
```

　　编码后的字串表是的含义是 `[(3,8),(0,9),(2,5)]`，每个括号表示的是 `(数字出现次数,对应的数字)`，那么题意就比较清楚了。

### 1. Stack

```python
# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(n)
class RLEIterator:

    def __init__(self, A: List[int]):
        self.stack = []
        n = len(A)
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            if A[i] > 0:
                self.stack.insert(0, (A[i], A[i+1]))

    def next(self, n: int) -> int:
        while n > 0:
            if self.stack:
                cnt, num = self.stack.pop()
                if n > cnt:
                    n -= cnt
                else:
                    res = num
                    cnt -= n
                    self.stack.append((cnt, num))
                    return res
            else:
                return -1
        
# Your RLEIterator object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = RLEIterator(A)
# param_1 = obj.next(n)

# 9/9 cases passed (36 ms)
# Your runtime beats 70.12 % of python3 submissions
# Your memory usage beats 100 % of python3 submissions (13.2 MB)
```
