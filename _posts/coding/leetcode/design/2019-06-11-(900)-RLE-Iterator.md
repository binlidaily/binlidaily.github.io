## Description
Write an iterator that iterates through a run-length encoded sequence.

The iterator is initialized by RLEIterator(int[] A), where A is a run-length encoding of some sequence.  More specifically, for all even i, A[i] tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value A[i+1] is repeated in the sequence.

The iterator supports one function: next(int n), which exhausts the next n elements (n >= 1) and returns the last element exhausted in this way.  If there is no element left to exhaust, next returns -1 instead.

For example, we start with A = [3,8,0,9,2,5], which is a run-length encoding of the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].  This is because the sequence can be read as "three eights, zero nines, two fives".

 

Example 1:
```
Input: ["RLEIterator","next","next","next","next"], [[[3,8,0,9,2,5]],[2],[1],[1],[2]]
Output: [null,8,8,5,-1]
Explanation: 
RLEIterator is initialized with RLEIterator([3,8,0,9,2,5]).
This maps to the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].
RLEIterator.next is then called 4 times:

.next(2) exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [8, 5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 5.  The remaining sequence is now [5].

.next(2) exhausts 2 terms, returning -1.  This is because the first term exhausted was 5,
but the second term did not exist.  Since the last term exhausted does not exist, we return -1.
```
Note:

1. 0 <= A.length <= 1000
2. A.length is an even integer.
3. 0 <= A[i] <= 10^9
4. There are at most 1000 calls to RLEIterator.next(int n) per test case.
5. Each call to RLEIterator.next(int n) will have 1 <= n <= 10^9.

## Solutions
　　这里主要搞清楚题目是啥意思，[Run-length Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) 要明白是怎么回事，然后结合题意要理解，比如这里的例子：

```python
# 输入：其实是编码后的字串
[3,8,0,9,2,5]

# 输出：编码前的字串
[8,8,8,5,5] 
```

　　编码后的字串表是的含义是 `[(3,8),(0,9),(2,5)]`，每个括号表示的是 `(数字出现次数,对应的数字)`，那么题意就比较清楚了。

```python
class RLEIterator(object):

    def __init__(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        """
        self.seq = []
        l = len(A)
        for i in range(0, l, 2):
            if A[i] != 0:
                self.seq.insert(0, [A[i], A[i+1]])

    def next(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # 因为不知道具体要循环多少次，最好用 while
        while n > 0:
            if self.seq:
                i = self.seq.pop()
                if n > i[0]:
                    n -= i[0]
                else:
                    res = i[1]
                    i[0] = i[0] - n
                    self.seq.append(i)
                    return res
            else:
                return -1


# Your RLEIterator object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = RLEIterator(A)
# param_1 = obj.next(n)

# Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 72.39% of Python online submissions for RLE Iterator.
# Memory Usage: 12.2 MB, less than 45.99% of Python online submissions for RLE Iterator.
