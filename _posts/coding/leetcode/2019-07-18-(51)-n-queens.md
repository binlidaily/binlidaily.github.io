The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n×n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

![](/img/media/15634559500760.jpg)


Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

Example:
```
Input: 4
Output: [
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.
```

## Solutions

```python
class Solution(object):
    def dfs(self, n, queens, xydiff, xysum, res):
        q = len(queens) # q is the index of row
        if q == n:
            res.append(queens)
            return
        
        for p in range(n): # p is the index of column
            if p in queens or q - p in xydiff or q + p in xysum:
                continue
            self.dfs(n, queens + [p], 
                     xydiff + [q - p], 
                     xysum + [q + p], res)
            
    def solveNQueens(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: List[List[str]]
        """
        res = []
        self.dfs(n, [], [], [], res)
        return [["." * i + "Q" + "." * (n - i - 1) for i in sol] for sol in res]
