## Description

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 3
Output: "III"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 4
Output: "IV"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: 9
Output: "IX"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```


## Solutions
### 1. String

```python
# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(n)
class Solution:
    def intToRoman(self, num: int) -> str:
        values = [ 1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1 ]
        numerals = [ "M", "CM", "D", "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I" ]
        res, i = "", 0
        while num:
            res += (num // values[i]) * numerals[i]
            num %= values[i]
            i += 1
        return res

# 3999/3999 cases passed (52 ms)
