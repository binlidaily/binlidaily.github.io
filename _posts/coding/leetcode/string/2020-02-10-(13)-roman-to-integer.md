## Description

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "III"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "IV"
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "IX"
Output: 9
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```


## Solutions
### 1. String

```python
# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(n)
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        _dict = {'I':1,'V':5,'X':10,'L':50,'C':100,'D':500,'M':1000}
        prev = 0
        sum = 0
        for i in s[::-1]:
            curr = _dict[i]
            if prev > curr:
                sum -= curr
            else:
                sum += curr
            prev = curr
        return sum
        
# 3999/3999 cases passed (40 ms)
# Your runtime beats 88.02 % of python3 submissions
# Your memory usage beats 100 % of python3 submissions (12.7 MB)
```
