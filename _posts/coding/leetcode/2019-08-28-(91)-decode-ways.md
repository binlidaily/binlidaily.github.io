A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
```
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
```
Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

Example 1:
```
Input: "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```

## Solutions
　　看例子 226 其实可以拆分成两个部分来看待，取一个字符，看其是否符合要求，如果符合就把其到这个一个字符位置的组合个数算上，如果不符合那就不算，留着零的状态；然后取两个字符采用同样的过程。

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numDecodings(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not s or len(s) == 0:
            return 0
        n = len(s)
        dp = [0 for _ in range(n+1)]
        dp[0] = 1
        dp[1] = 0 if s[0] == '0' else 1
        
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            one = int(s[i-1:i])
            two = int(s[i-2:i])
            if 1 <= one <= 9:
                dp[i] = dp[i-1]
            if 10 <= two <= 26:
                dp[i] = dp[i] + dp[i-2]
        return dp[n]
