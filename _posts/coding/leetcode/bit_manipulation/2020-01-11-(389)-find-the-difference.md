## Description

Given two strings ***s\*** and ***t\*** which consist of only lowercase letters.

String ***t\*** is generated by random shuffling string ***s\*** and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in ***t\***.

**Example:**

```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```


## Solutions
### 1. Bit manipulation

```python
# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(1)
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        code = 0
        for ch in s + t:
            code ^= ord(ch)
        return chr(code)
# Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 65.80%
# Memory Usage: 12.8 MB, less than 100.00%
```
