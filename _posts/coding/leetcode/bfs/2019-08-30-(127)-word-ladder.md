## Description

Given two words (*beginWord* and *endWord*), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from *beginWord* to *endWord*, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that *beginWord* is *not* a transformed word.

**Note:**

- Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
- All words have the same length.
- All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
- You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
- You may assume *beginWord* and *endWord* are non-empty and are not the same.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```

## Solutions
### 1. BFS

```python
class Solution(object):
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord, endWord, wordList):
        """
        :type beginWord: str
        :type endWord: str
        :type wordList: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        wordList = set(wordList)
        visited = set()
        queue = collections.deque([(beginWord, 1)])
        alpha = string.ascii_lowercase # 'abcd...z'
        while queue:
            word, length = queue.popleft()
            
            if word == endWord:
                return length
            n = len(word)
            for i in range(n):
                for ch in alpha:
                    newWord = word[:i] + ch + word[i+1:]
                    if newWord in wordList and newWord not in visited:
                        queue.append((newWord, length+1))
                        visited.add(newWord)
        return 0

### 2. Bidirectional BFS

### 3. DFS 
　　第一个想法总是用 DFS 回溯，其实也可以做，但是这里不合适，因为要求是求最短的路径，如果是回溯的话会优先往深了找，这样会超时。
