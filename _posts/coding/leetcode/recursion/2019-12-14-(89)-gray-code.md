## Description

The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer *n* representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

For a given n, a gray code sequence may not be uniquely defined.
For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence.

00 - 0
10 - 2
11 - 3
01 - 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 0
Output: [0]
Explanation: We define the gray code sequence to begin with 0.
             A gray code sequence of n has size = 2n, which for n = 0 the size is 20 = 1.
             Therefore, for n = 0 the gray code sequence is [0].
```

## Solutions
### 1. Recursion

```python
# Time: O(nlogn)
# Space: O(n)
class Solution:
    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        if n==0:
            return [0]
        if n==1:
            return [0,1]
        if n==2:
            return [0,1,3,2]
        else:
            return self.grayCode(n-1) + [x + (2**(n-1)) for x in self.grayCode(n-1)[::-1]]
# Runtime: 36 ms, faster than 72.31%
# Memory Usage: 12.7 MB, less than 100.00%
```
