You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

```
Example 2:
```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

## Solutions
　　在学回溯的时候，看到什么就觉得都该用回溯做，结果纠结半天没想出来。这里只要用动规求解就好了，主要是要分清楚状态转移矩阵：`dp[i]=max(nums[i]+dp[i-2], dp[i-1])`。

```python
class Solution(object):
    def rob(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if nums is None or len(nums) < 1:
            return 0
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]
        # if len(nums) == 2:
        #     return max(nums[0], nums[1])
        dp = [nums[0]]
        dp.append(max(nums[0], nums[1]))
        
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(2, n):
            dp.append(max(nums[i]+dp[i-2], dp[i-1]))
        
        return dp[-1]
