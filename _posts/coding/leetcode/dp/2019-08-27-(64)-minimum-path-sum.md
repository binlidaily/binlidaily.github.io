Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example:
```python
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```

## Solutions
　　2 为的 dp：

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minPathSum(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not grid:
            return 0
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
        for i in range(1, m):
            dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + grid[i][0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[0][i] = dp[0][i - 1] + grid[0][i]
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + grid[i][j]
        return dp[-1][-1]
