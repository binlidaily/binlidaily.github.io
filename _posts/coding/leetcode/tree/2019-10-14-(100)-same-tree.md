Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1:
```
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   3     2   3

        [1,2,3],   [1,2,3]

Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input:     1         1
          /           \
         2             2

        [1,2],     [1,null,2]

Output: false
```
Example 3:
```
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   1     1   2

        [1,2,1],   [1,1,2]

Output: false
```
## Solutions
### 1. 递归

```python
# Time Complexity: O(logn)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
            
    def isSameTree(self, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if p and q:
            return p.val == q.val and self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
        else:
            return p == q
# Runtime: 40 ms, faster than 39.43% of Python3 online submissions for Same Tree.
# Memory Usage: 13.6 MB, less than 5.72% of Python3 online submissions for Same Tree.
```
### 2. DFS-迭代/递推


```python
# Time Complexity: O(logn)
# Space Complexity: O(n)
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
            
    def isSameTree(self, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:
        stack = [(p, q)]
        while stack:
            node1, node2 = stack.pop()
            if not node1 and not node2:
                continue
            elif None in [node1, node2]:
                return False
            else:
                if node1.val != node2.val:
                    return False
                stack.append((node1.right, node2.right))
                stack.append((node1.left, node2.left))
        return True
# Runtime: 36 ms, faster than 74.66% of Python3 online submissions for Same Tree.
# Memory Usage: 13.7 MB, less than 5.72% of Python3 online submissions for Same Tree.
```

### 3. BFS

```python
# Time Complexity: O(logn)
# Space Complexity: O(n)
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
            
    def isSameTree(self, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:
        queue = [(p, q)]
        while queue:
            node1, node2 = queue.pop(0)
            if not node1 and not node2:
                continue
            elif None in [node1, node2]:
                return False
            else:
                if node1.val != node2.val:
                    return False
                queue.append((node1.left, node2.left))
                queue.append((node1.right, node2.right))
        return True
# Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 92.92% of Python3 online submissions for Same Tree.
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 5.72% of Python3 online submissions for Same Tree.
