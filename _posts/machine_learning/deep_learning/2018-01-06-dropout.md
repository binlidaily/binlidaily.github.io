**Why does DropOut work?**
The idea behind the dropout is similar to the model ensembles. Due to the dropout layer, different sets of neurons which are switched off, represent a different architecture and all these different architectures are trained in parallel with weight given to each subset and the summation of weights being one. For n neurons attached to DropOut, the number of subset architectures formed is 2^n. So it amounts to prediction being averaged over these ensembles of models. This provides a structured model regularization which helps in avoiding the over-fitting. Another view of DropOut being helpful is that since neurons are randomly chosen, they tend to avoid developing co-adaptations among themselves thereby enabling them to develop meaningful features, independent of others.
