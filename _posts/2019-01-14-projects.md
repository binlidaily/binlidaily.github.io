## 3. Open Projects
I have been collecting some excellent open sources when I study some stuff, so I am gonna classify these projects and make a good list for everyone to view. Thank all these generous people. Standing on the shoulder of the giants, we can see farther.

### 3.1 [PRML algorithms implemented in Python](https://github.com//ctgk/PRML)

Python codes implementing algorithms described in Bishop's book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"

### 3.2 [TensorFlow Tutorial and Examples for Beginners with Latest APIs ](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples)

This tutorial was designed for easily diving into TensorFlow, through examples. For readability, it includes both notebooks and source codes with explanation.

### 3.3 [Machine Learning From Scratch](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/ML-From-Scratch)

Python implementations of some of the fundamental Machine Learning models and algorithms from scratch.

The purpose of this project is not to produce as optimized and computationally efficient algorithms as possible but rather to present the inner workings of them in a transparent and accessible way.

### 3.4 [Minimal and clean examples of machine learning algorithms implementations](https://github.com/rushter/MLAlgorithms)

A collection of minimal and clean implementations of machine learning algorithms.

### 3.5 [Codes for Statistical Learning Method](https://github.com/WenDesi/lihang_book_algorithm)

Implementations of Machine Learning algorithms in Statistical Learning Method.
