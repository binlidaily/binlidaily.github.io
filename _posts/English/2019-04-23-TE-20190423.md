After HURRICANE BETSY pummelled  New Orleans in 1965, causing damage so severe that Betsy was retired from the rotating list of names given to Atlantic hurricanes, the Governor of Louisiana, John McKeithen, pledged that nothing like it would happen in his state again. Exactly 40 years later Hurricane Katrina brought even greater destruction to the city, and hazard planners were deemed to ignore the lessons of the past.
