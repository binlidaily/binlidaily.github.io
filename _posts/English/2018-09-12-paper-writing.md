## Abstract
We finish by identifying promising directions for future research.



## Introduction
As the cornerstone of image understanding and computer vision, object detection forms the basis of solving more complex or high level vision tasks such as segmentation, scene understanding, object tracking, image captioning, event detection, and activity recognition.

We have preferred to include top journal and conference papers. Due to limitation on space and our knowledge, we sincerely apologize to those authors whose works are not included in this paper.

We restrict ourselves to still pictures and leave video object detection as a separate topic.
