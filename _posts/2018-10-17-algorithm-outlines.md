In order to facilitate the search, I wrote this blog. I've collected all algorithms that I learned or want to learn in `Machine Learning`, `Deep Learning`, `Mathematics` and `Data Structure and Algorithms`. I hope I can improve my skills and knowledge in these area with writing the interpretation about these algorithms. 

## Theoretical Machine Learning
